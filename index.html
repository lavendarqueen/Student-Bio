      <p>Phyllis Ann Lataille was employed as a paralegal for 20-plus years, when a serious family accident changed her life forever. A huge SciFi fan with a fascination with computers, and having taken some rudimentary coding courses in the past, she was ready for a change in career path.  She enrolled in the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp Course, launching her into the world of Web Development. It was a whirlwind, with technology issues and the usual bugs to be chased down in the first weeks of coding. However, Phyllis learned a great deal from those experiences. Searching and implementing the solutions  served to increase her coding skills and knowledge base.
